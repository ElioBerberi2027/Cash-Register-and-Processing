Hello Welcome to my First c# project

The goal of this project is to create a way to simulate the processing of clothing items and storing them in a simple local database
Then using that database to conduct a "check-out" where the "cashier" (user) can simulate helping a customer purchase clothing
I hope to familiarize myself more with c# and its tools to improve as a developer and extend my knowledge of programming languages
